# R
# Overview

* This is to help learn R for data analysis of a masters project and for a part time job as a data analyst for a university. 

* In learning R i needed a place to experiment with the language and try different ways of typeing code.  this softeware is for the purpose of creating example expressions of different code. The primary has all expressions of different variables and data structures

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
